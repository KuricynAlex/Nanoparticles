# K - Nanoparticles
coding nanoparticle model with LAMMPS and python 3.7+

Goals:
1) Create right LAMMPS model --- UNDONE
2) Take data, create temperature dependences and make sure hysteresis --- UNDONE
3) Repeat for different potentials of K (view ) and choose the best --- UNDONE
4) Clear up a dependence from radius --- UNDONE
5) Visualisation (?) --- UNDONE 


6) Change the system to NaK, Na2K --- UNDONE
7) See Eutectic systems and their phase diagrams. Write down to Charnaya to keep working
